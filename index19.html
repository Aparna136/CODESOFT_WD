            <ul> 
                <l1>~She is truly an inspiration to me. Her admirable qualities and achievements
            make her a role model for many.</l1><br>
            
               <l2>~Sister Nivedita propagated this message through her inspiring eloquence and manifold activities.
              Many of Nivedita’s sayings are weighty and revealing. 
              A sample suffices to illustrate: “Let us serve Mother India instead of supplicating unseen deities.” <br>
              
              <l3>~She was a supporter of the Swadeshi Movement which called for the boycott of imported British goods
             in favour of domestically produced handmade goods
             She kept on promoting Indian arts and the education of Indian women where she went and gave lectures
             in India and overseas.</l3><br>

              <l4> ~One is wonderstruck at the brilliance of her thought and action. Two reasons account for it: (1) she had developed a keen acumen and sensitivity by constant contemplation, (2) she had the unique opportunity 
            of interacting with Swami Vivekananda directly and listening to several of his speeches live.</l4><br>

             <l5>~Sister Nivedita’s ideas on Indian nationhood assume all the more importance. They shed light on many of the intricacies of the debate on Indian nationalism, like the 
            idea of India, a pre-history of Indian nationhood, the dynamics between diversity and unity, and so on.</l5><br>

             <l6> ~She has been described by many other names too. 'Lokmata' by Rabindranath Tagore, 'Lioness' by Swami Vivekananda, 'Agnisikha' or flame of fire by Sri Aurobindo,
             'Champion of India' in England and 'Sister' by all the people of India</l6>
